# Portfolio App Tutorial with Django
This is the first of our Year 2 Star Coders sessions!  
The goal will be to get familiar with using Git and Github and begin a starter Portfolio web applicatoin using Django and Postgres.  
In future sessions we will build out this application and deploy it to an actual website using Heroku!  

This project is taken from this [RealPython tutorial](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/) by Jasmine Fisher.

## Git + Environment Setup
### Git  
[Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf )  
[Installing Git On You Machine](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

1. The first step is to install Git. If Git is already installed on your machine, sign up for your own account on Github.com. 
2. Fork this repository into your own account. 
3. Clone the repo onto your local machine.


### IDE
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox)  

1. Install either VSCode or Pycharm if you have not already done so (any other editor is fine as well, these are just recommended).
2. Open your project and make a change to the README.txt file, commit that change, push up that change to your repository in Github.
3. Open up the project in Github, make a change to the README.txt file in Github directly. Then pull that change down using `git pull` on your machine.  


### Postgres  
[Install Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)  
[Postgres Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)  
[Postgres Basics](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/postgres-basics)  
[Heroku + Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql)  

1. Install Postgres if it is not already installed on your machine. Follow the link above.  
2. Start up the default Postgres server and database (the default should be named just 'postgres')  


### Django  
[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/)  
[Django Model Field References](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/fields/)  
[Video Overview of Django Portfolio Project](https://realpython.com/courses/django-portfolio-project/)  

Make sure you have python 3.x installed. You can verify the version by the following command: `python --version` and `python3 --version`. 
1. Install Django through Pip: `python3 -m pip install Django`. 
2. Install postgress support through Pip: `python3 -m pip install psycopg2`
You can use these pip commands to install other packages and dependencies as needed.  

## Portfolio Tutorial: Add the Projects application to your Django project
Work through the tutorial [here](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/#showcase-your-projects), completing the **Showcase Your Projects** section.  
Note: All references to the previous 'Hello World' section have been removed from our starter code. 

### Heroku  
[Getting Started With Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
[Heroku Working With Django](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/working-with-django)   
[Deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) 

Coming soon in the next session we will explore using Heroku. You are encouraged to skip ahead and learn on your own!
